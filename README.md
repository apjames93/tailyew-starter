## ✨ What is this?

This is a scaffold app for TailYew, accessible, and fully typed UI component library built with Yew and styled using Tailwind. This project provides:

- 🔥 Instant setup with Yew 0.21 and Tailwind CSS
- 🧱 Example components and pages
- 🚀 Production-ready file structure
- 🧠 Designed around [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

## 📦 System Requirements

You'll need the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) + [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
- [`cargo-watch`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) — for hot reloading
- [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) — for local development to server FE and build tailwind css 

Install example:

```sh
cargo install wasm-pack cargo-watch
npm install install
brew install binaryen
```

## 🚀 Quickstart

```sh
# Clone the scaffold
git clone https://github.com/tailyew/create-tailyew-app
cd create-tailyew-app

cargo build

# install tailwindcss cli and server
npm i

# Start the dev server with hot reloads
make hot-run
```

## 🧩 Using TailYew Components

To use TailYew components in your Yew project:

1. Add the dependency:

```sh
cargo add tailyew
```

2. Import and use components:

```rust
use tailyew::atoms::Button;

html! {
    <Button label="Click me!" />
}
```

3. Tailwind classes are auto-applied via the included `tailwind.config.js` and `main.css`. Custom theme colors and fonts are already configured.
